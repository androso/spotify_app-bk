## Spotify Connected App
This is the End Product of 'Build a spotify connected app' newline course

This repl has the backend code of the web app, for the frontend see: https://replit.com/@androsoa3/yourstats

Because Spotify doesn't extend quota for 'hobby' projects anymore, only people who i add on my dev console can see their stats (let me know if you want).

The intention for this project was to dive into the backend with nodejs, which i'm currently learning :)

## Installation and Set Up
1. Register a Spotify app in your [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/) and add `https://yourReplName.yourUsername.repl.co/callback` (for this first set up the repl) as a Redirect URI in the app settings.
2. Add your unique `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET` from the spotify dashboard to Secrets.
3. Install dependencies
4. Don't worry about deployment because we are in Replit ðŸ’–
